                <h3>1. Wear a Helmet</h3>
                <p>Always wear a properly fitted helmet to protect your head in case of accidents.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>2. Obey Traffic Rules</h3>
                <p>Follow traffic signals, stop signs, and use hand signals when turning. Bicycles must obey the same rules as vehicles.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>3. Stay Visible</h3>
                <p>Use lights and reflective gear, especially when riding at night or in low visibility conditions. Make sure drivers can see you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>4. Use Bike Lanes</h3>
                <p>Whenever possible, ride in designated bike lanes or on bike paths. This helps separate cyclists from motorized traffic.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>5. Signal Your Intentions</h3>
                <p>Use hand signals to indicate when you're turning left, right, or stopping. This helps drivers and other cyclists know your intentions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>6. Check Your Equipment</h3>
                <p>Regularly inspect your bike to ensure it's in good working condition. Check brakes, tires, and lights if applicable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>7. Ride in the Same Direction as Traffic</h3>
                <p>Always ride on the right side of the road, in the same direction as traffic. Never ride against the flow of traffic.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>8. Watch for Parked Cars</h3>
                <p>Be cautious when passing parked cars, as doors can suddenly open. Give parked cars enough space.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>9. Avoid Distractions</h3>
                <p>Don't use your phone or wear headphones while cycling. Stay focused on the road and your surroundings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>10. Stay Alert</h3>
                <p>Pay attention to your surroundings. Watch for pedestrians, other cyclists, and unexpected obstacles.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>11. Maintain a Safe Following Distance</h3>
                <p>Leave enough space between your bike and the vehicle in front of you to react to sudden stops or maneuvers. Maintain a safe following distance, especially at higher speeds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="safety-card">
                <h3>12. Be Mindful of Weather Conditions</h3>
                <p>Adjust your riding style according to the weather. Wet or icy roads can reduce traction, so slow down and use caution when cycling in adverse weather conditions.</p>
